            <p>It's time to create your new robot friend. But he needs some assembly first! Using everything you learned in this section, and your best friend: Google Developer Tools in the browser, try to assemble your new robot friend. <br><br>If you get stuck, in the next lecture you will find my solution (but remember that there are many solutions to this layout problem).<br><br>Once you are done, customize your robot, and add any animation you want. Then, you can submit it to our slack in the #css section for myself and others to view! You can send your CSS and HTML5 files or screen capture your robot.<br><br>Good luck!</p>
